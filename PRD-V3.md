## 3. Product Features

### 3.1. Dynamic Agent Management

*   **Description:** Users can create, edit, and delete agents through the web UI or CLI.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want to be able to create a new agent from a template, so that I can quickly get started with a new agent.
    *   As an AI engineer, I want to be able to customize the persona and prompts of an agent, so that I can fine-tune its behavior.
    *   As a project manager, I want to be able to see a list of all the agents in the project, so that I can get an overview of the available agents.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can create a new agent by providing a name, a persona, and a set of prompts.
    *   Users can edit the name, persona, and prompts of an existing agent.
    *   Users can delete an agent.

### 3.2. Conversational Interaction

*   **Description:** Users can interact with agents using natural language.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want to be able to ask an agent to write a function for me, so that I can save time on writing boilerplate code.
    *   As a project manager, I want to be able to ask an agent for the status of a task, so that I can get a quick update on the project's progress.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system can understand and respond to natural language queries.
    *   The system can handle a variety of different queries, such as asking for information, giving commands, and asking for help.

### 3.3. Persistent Agent Memory

*   **Description:** Agents can remember past interactions and learn from them.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want the agent to remember my preferred coding style, so that it can generate code that is consistent with my style.
    *   As a project manager, I want the agent to remember the context of our previous conversations, so that I don't have to repeat myself.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The agent's memory is stored in a database and persists across sessions.
    *   The agent can access and update its memory during conversations.

### 3.4. Interactive CLI

*   **Description:** The CLI provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a developer, I want the CLI to provide me with suggestions and auto-completion, so that I can work more efficiently.
    *   As a new user, I want the CLI to guide me through the available commands, so that I can quickly learn how to use the system.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The CLI provides an interactive mode with prompts and suggestions.
    *   The CLI provides a REPL for interactive sessions.

### 3.5. Terminal Dashboard

*   **Description:** The CLI displays a text-based dashboard with real-time information about the system.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a project manager, I want to be able to see the status of all the tasks in the project, so that I can get a quick overview of the project's progress.
    *   As a developer, I want to be able to see the status of my current task, so that I can stay focused on my work.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The dashboard displays information about agents, workflows, and the state machine.
    *   The dashboard is updated in real-time.

### 3.6. Integrated Web IDE

*   **Description:** The web interface provides a full-fledged web-based IDE for MADACE.
*   **User Stories:**
