# MADACE-Method v3.0 - Project Plan

> This document outlines the project plan for implementing the MADACE-Method v3.0 architecture.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

Before implementing ANY feature in v3.0, developers MUST review and follow these rules:

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read **ARCHITECTURE-V3.md** "CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES" section
- [ ] Verify file access uses `existsSync()` checks before reading
- [ ] Confirm API routes return graceful fallbacks for missing files
- [ ] Ensure UI components match Prisma schema types exactly
- [ ] Verify all JSON fields (persona, menu, prompts) are handled as `JsonValue`
- [ ] Confirm all API routes have try-catch error handling
- [ ] Test both development AND production Docker builds
- [ ] Verify health checks pass with missing optional files

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **NEVER** assume development files exist in production
❌ **NEVER** flatten Prisma JSON fields into component props
❌ **NEVER** throw unhandled errors in API routes
❌ **NEVER** use `fs.readFile()` without existence checks
❌ **NEVER** create custom types that don't match Prisma schema

✅ **ALWAYS** check file existence with `existsSync()`
✅ **ALWAYS** return graceful fallbacks for missing files
✅ **ALWAYS** use Prisma-generated types from `@prisma/client`
✅ **ALWAYS** wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
✅ **ALWAYS** test in production Docker container before committing

### Testing Requirements

Every PR for v3.0 features MUST include:

1. **Development Testing**: Feature works in `npm run dev`
2. **Production Build**: `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
3. **Docker Testing**: Feature works in production Docker container
4. **Error Scenarios**: Tested with missing files and invalid data
5. **Type Safety**: `npm run type-check` passes with zero errors

### Code Review Checklist

Reviewers must verify:

- [ ] No direct file access without existence checks
- [ ] All API routes have proper error handling
- [ ] UI components use correct Prisma types
- [ ] No flattened JSON fields in components
- [ ] Production Docker build tested and working
- [ ] Health checks pass in all scenarios

## 4. Resources

- **Development Team:** 2-3 developers with experience in TypeScript, React, Node.js, and database management.
- **NLU Service:** A subscription to an NLU service like Dialogflow or a self-hosted Rasa instance.
- **Infrastructure:** A server for hosting the database and the application.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### Original Risks (All Successfully Mitigated)

**Risk 1: Complex Feature Implementation**
- **Original Risk**: Conversational interaction, integrated web IDE, and real-time collaboration features might take longer than expected.
- **Actual Outcome**: ✅ All features successfully implemented within timeline
- **Mitigation Applied**: Incremental implementation with thorough testing at each milestone
- **Result**: Production-ready features with comprehensive test coverage (692+ tests passing)

**Risk 2: External Service Dependencies**
- **Original Risk**: NLU providers might introduce costs and limitations
- **Actual Outcome**: ✅ Successfully integrated Dialogflow CX with graceful fallback
- **Mitigation Applied**: Designed modular NLU provider interface for easy switching
- **Result**: System works with or without NLU service configured, providing flexibility

### New Lessons Learned

- Delivered 2 significant bonus features (LLM Provider Selector, Agent Import/Seeding) beyond original scope
- Demonstrates system flexibility and developer productivity

**Achievement 2: Timeline Accuracy**
