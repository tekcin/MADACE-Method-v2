## ⚠️ Plan Status

**This document describes the REJECTED 12-week multi-tier plan.**

**Current Status**: Architecture simplified to **Next.js 14 Full-Stack TypeScript**

**New Timeline**: **4 weeks to Alpha MVP** (vs 12 weeks in this rejected plan)

**See**: [ADR-003: Architecture Simplification](./docs/adrs/ADR-003-architecture-simplification.md) for:
- Simplified 4-week implementation plan
- Next.js-only architecture
- TypeScript business logic
- No Rust/Python/FFI complexity

---

## Executive Summary (SUPERSEDED)

**NOTE**: This executive summary describes the REJECTED multi-tier plan.

The APPROVED plan uses Next.js 14 full-stack TypeScript, eliminating Rust and Python entirely. This provides:
- **3x faster development**: 4 weeks vs 12 weeks
- **Single runtime**: Node.js only (vs 3 runtimes)
- **Single language**: TypeScript (vs Rust + Python + TypeScript)
- **Zero FFI complexity**: No FFI debugging or memory leaks
- **Proven stack**: Battle-tested Next.js instead of experimental architecture

**For Current Plan**: See ADR-003 implementation checklist.

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks

**Risk 1: FFI Stability**
- **Impact:** High - Crashes could lose user data
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, safe wrappers, error handling
- **Monitoring:** Weekly FFI stability tests

**Risk 2: State Machine Corruption**
- **Impact:** Critical - Data loss
- **Mitigation:** Atomic writes, backups, validation
- **Monitoring:** Daily integrity checks

**Risk 3: Timeline Slippage**
- **Impact:** Medium - Delayed market entry
- **Mitigation:** Buffer time in estimates, weekly reviews
- **Monitoring:** Burndown charts, velocity tracking

**Risk 4: LLM API Changes**
- **Impact:** Medium - Breaking changes
- **Mitigation:** Version pinning, abstraction layer
- **Monitoring:** API changelog monitoring

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Weekly Progress Reviews** - Track actual vs. estimated effort
2. **Automated Testing** - Catch regressions early
3. **Continuous Integration** - Deploy and test frequently
4. **User Feedback Loops** - Validate features with real users
5. **Technical Debt Tracking** - Don't accumulate shortcuts
