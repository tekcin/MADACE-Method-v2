# EPIC-V3-001: Scale-Adaptive Workflow Router

**Epic ID:** EPIC-V3-001  
**Epic Name:** Scale-Adaptive Workflow Router  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Effort Estimate:** 34 points (3 weeks)  
**Target Quarter:** Q2 2026  
**Owner:** PM + Architect  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planning

---

## Epic Summary

Dynamic workflow routing system that assesses project complexity (Levels 0-4) and automatically selects appropriate planning workflows. Eliminates over-planning for simple projects and under-planning for complex systems.

**Key Innovation from BMAD v6:** Scale-Adaptive Workflow Engineâ„¢

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State (v2.0):**

- One-size-fits-all planning workflow
- Simple scripts get over-planned (unnecessary PRD, architecture docs)
- Complex systems get under-planned (missing tech specs, security docs)
- Users must manually decide documentation depth
- No guidance on appropriate planning level

**Pain Points:**

- Solo developer creating utility script: Spends 2 hours on PRD for 30-minute project
- Enterprise team building distributed system: Misses security spec, causes production issues
- New users: Don't know which documents to create
- PM agents: No criteria for determining project complexity

**Impact:**

- Wasted time on unnecessary documentation
- Missing critical documentation for complex projects
- Poor user experience for beginners
- Inconsistent planning quality

---

## Solution Overview

Implement **Scale-Adaptive Workflow Router** with:

1. **Complexity Assessment Algorithm** (8 criteria)
   - Project size, team size, codebase size, integrations
   - User base, security requirements, estimated duration
   - Scoring system: 0-40 points â†’ Levels 0-4

2. **Dynamic Workflow Routing** (YAML-based)
   - Level 0: Direct to stories (no docs)
   - Level 1: Lightweight PRD + stories
   - Level 2: Standard PRD + architecture + stories
   - Level 3: Detailed PRD + epics + tech specs + architecture
   - Level 4: Comprehensive (+ security spec + DevOps spec)

3. **User Override System**
   - Manual level selection option
   - "Skip assessment" for experienced users
   - Level adjustment after assessment

4. **Assessment Report Generation**
   - Detailed scoring breakdown
   - Recommendations and rationale
   - Risk assessment per level
   - Output: `docs/scale-assessment.md`

## User Stories

### US-001: Simple Script Planning (Level 0)

**As a** solo developer creating a utility script  
**I want** to start coding immediately without documentation overhead  
**So that** I don't waste time on planning for a 30-minute project

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Assessment determines Level 0 in <5 seconds
- Routes directly to story creation (no PRD, no architecture)
- Time from `madace plan` to first story: <5 minutes
- Assessment report still generated for record-keeping

---

### US-002: Enterprise System Planning (Level 4)

**As a** PM planning an enterprise distributed system  
**I want** comprehensive documentation including security and DevOps specs  
**So that** nothing critical is missed before implementation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Assessment detects enterprise characteristics (team size, security, integrations)
- Routes to Level 4 workflow (PRD + Epics + Tech Specs + Architecture + Security + DevOps)
- All documents generated within 2 hours
- Clear dependencies and sequencing

---

### US-003: Manual Override

**As an** experienced PM who knows my project needs  
**I want** to manually select the planning level  
**So that** I can override auto-detection when I disagree

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- CLI flag: `madace plan --level=2` skips assessment
- Web UI: Level selector dropdown with descriptions
- Override reason captured in assessment report
- System respects manual selection

---

### US-004: Assessment Report

**As a** team lead reviewing project planning  
**I want** to see detailed assessment reasoning  
**So that** I can validate the planning level is appropriate

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Report shows all 8 criteria scores
- Clear explanation for each score
- Recommendations with rationale
- Risk assessment for chosen level
- Alternative levels suggested

---

## Technical Specifications

### Assessment Algorithm

**Complexity Criteria (8 factors):**

```typescript
interface ComplexityAssessment {
  projectSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'enterprise'; // 0-5 points
  teamSize: number; // 0-5 points
  existingCodebase: boolean; // +2 if true
  codebaseSize?: number; // 0-5 points
  integrationCount: number; // 0-5 points
  userBase: 'internal' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'; // 0-5 points
  securityRequirements: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'high' | 'critical'; // 0-5 points
  estimatedDuration: number; // 0-5 points
}

// Total: 0-40 points
// Level 0: 0-5 points
// Level 1: 6-12 points
// Level 2: 13-20 points
// Level 3: 21-30 points
// Level 4: 31-40 points
```

**Scoring Logic:**

```typescript
function assessComplexity(input: ProjectInput): ComplexityLevel {
  let score = 0;

  // Project size scoring
  score += projectSizeScore(input.projectSize);

  // Team size scoring
  score += teamSizeScore(input.teamSize);

  // Existing codebase bonus
  if (input.existingCodebase) score += 2;

  // Codebase size scoring
  if (input.codebaseSize) score += codebaseSizeScore(input.codebaseSize);

  // Integration count scoring
  score += integrationScore(input.integrationCount);

  // User base scoring
  score += userBaseScore(input.userBase);

  // Security requirements scoring
  score += securityScore(input.securityRequirements);

  // Duration scoring
  score += durationScore(input.estimatedDuration);

  return determineLevel(score);
}
```

### Workflow Routing YAML

```yaml
# workflows/route-workflow.yaml
workflow:
  name: 'Scale-Adaptive Workflow Router'
  description: 'Routes to appropriate planning workflow based on project complexity'
  version: '1.0.0'

  steps:
    - name: 'Gather Project Information'
      action: elicit
      prompts:
        - 'What type of project are you building?'
        - 'How many people are on your team?'
        - 'Is this a new project or existing codebase?'
        - 'How many external integrations (APIs, services)?'
        - 'What are your security requirements?'
        - 'Estimated project duration?'

    - name: 'Assess Project Complexity'
      action: assess_complexity
      input: '${PROJECT_INFO}'
      output_var: 'COMPLEXITY_LEVEL'

    - name: 'Generate Assessment Report'
