# EPIC-V3-003: Just-In-Time (JIT) Technical Specifications

**Epic ID:** EPIC-V3-003 | **Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** 21 points (2 weeks) | **Quarter:** Q2 2026

## Summary
Generate tech specs on-demand when epic implementation begins. Includes web research for latest APIs/standards.

## Problem
- Upfront tech specs become stale by implementation time
- No web research for latest API documentation
- Wasted time creating specs for epics that never get implemented

## Solution
- Trigger: Epic transition BACKLOG â†’ TODO activates JIT spec generation
- Context gathering: Load epic details, architecture, related code
- Web research: Automated search for relevant API docs, standards
- Output: `docs/tech-specs/${EPIC_ID}-spec.md`

## User Stories
1. **US-001:** As a developer, I want fresh tech specs that reflect current requirements
2. **US-002:** As an architect, I want tech specs to include latest API documentation
3. **US-003:** As a PM, I want to save time by only creating specs for implemented epics

## Implementation (2 weeks)
- Week 1: Context gathering workflow, web research integration
- Week 2: Template engine, state machine integration, testing

## Success Metrics
- 50% time savings vs manual spec creation
- 90%+ usage rate during implementation
- 100% freshness (no stale specs)

**Dependencies:** EPIC-V3-001 (Scale-Adaptive Router determines when to generate specs)
