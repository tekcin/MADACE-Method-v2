- Product Features (7 major epics)
- Technical Architecture (database schema, system diagram)
- Migration Strategy (v2.0 → v3.0)
- Success Metrics and Release Plan

**Scale Level Justification:**

- Timeline: 12 months (Q1-Q4 2026)
- Scope: Major architectural changes
- Team: 5 developers
- **Result: Level 4 (Enterprise)** ✅

### 2. Epics-V3.md - Epic Breakdown

**Purpose:** Breaks down v3.0 into manageable chunks

**10 Epics Defined:**

| Epic ID | Name                           | Priority | Effort   | Status     |

| V3-E7   | Real-Time Collaboration 👥     | P2       | 10 weeks | 📋 Planned |
| V3-E8   | Migration & Compatibility 🔄   | P0       | 4 weeks  | 📋 Planned |
| V3-E9   | Multi-User Authentication 🔐   | P1       | 3 weeks  | 📋 Planned |
| V3-E10  | Performance & Optimization ⚡  | P1       | 6 weeks  | 📋 Planned |

**Total:** 60 weeks (12 months with 5-person team)

**Each Epic Includes:**

- Problem statement
- Epic goal
- User stories (V3-EX-SX format)
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical notes
- Out of scope items

## 🏗️ Next Steps (Per MAM Level 4 Process)

### Step 3: Solution Architecture

**What:** High-level technical architecture for v3.0

**Deliverables:**

- System architecture diagram (expanded from PRD)
- Technology stack rationale (PostgreSQL vs MySQL, etc.)
- API design (REST + WebSocket endpoints)
- Database ERD (entity-relationship diagram)
- Security architecture
- Deployment architecture
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

### Step 4: Technical Specifications (Per Epic)

**What:** Detailed technical specs for each epic

**Level 4 Requirement:** Tech specs for major/complex epics

**Priority Order:**

1. V3-E2: Database Infrastructure (foundation)
2. V3-E1: Dynamic Agent Management (core feature)
3. V3-E7: Real-Time Collaboration (most complex)
4. V3-E6: Integrated Web IDE (complex integration)

**Per Tech Spec:**

- Detailed API endpoints
- Database schema (per epic)
- Code structure
- Libraries and dependencies
- Testing strategy
- Performance considerations

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks per epic (4 epics = 4-8 weeks)

### Step 5: Story Creation

**What:** Break each epic into implementable stories

**Format:**

- STORY-VX-EX-SX (e.g., STORY-V3-E1-S1)
- Each story: 1-3 days of work
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Points estimation (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Step 6: Implementation

**What:** Build v3.0 following the backlog

**State Machine:** BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE

**Rules:**

- Only ONE story in TODO
- Only ONE story in IN PROGRESS
- Complete story → Move to DONE → Next story from BACKLOG → TODO

## 📊 Validation: MADACE-Method Works at Scale!

### What This Proves

**Hypothesis:** MADACE-Method scales to Level 4 (Enterprise) projects

**Validation:**

1. ✅ Scale assessment accurately identified Level 4 requirements
2. ✅ PRD structure accommodates complex, multi-year projects
3. ✅ Epic breakdown handles 10 major features with dependencies
4. ✅ User story format scales to 50+ stories across 10 epics
5. ✅ Architecture requirements (DB, API, infrastructure) fit within framework
6. ✅ Timeline estimation (12 months) aligned with Level 4 guidance

**Conclusion:** MADACE-Method successfully handles enterprise-scale projects! ✅

### Key Insights

1. **Level 4 Projects Need:**
   - Comprehensive PRD (not just bullet points)
   - Detailed epics with technical notes
   - Solution architecture phase
   - Per-epic tech specs
   - 12+ month timeline

2. **MADACE-Method Strengths:**
   - Clear progression: PRD → Epics → Stories
   - Scale-adaptive (Level 0-4 framework works)
   - Natural language (easy to read and maintain)
   - AI-friendly (can be consumed by LLMs)

3. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Epic dependency visualization could be clearer
   - Need templates for tech specs
   - Story estimation guidelines needed
