## 4. Known Issues & Mitigations

### 4.1 Outstanding Issues from Beta

**From RELEASE-NOTES-v3.0-beta.md:**

1. **TypeScript errors in test files** (12 tests failing)
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Impact:** None on production, but affects developer experience
   - **Mitigation:** Fix in Phase 2 (Week 2-4)
   - **Timeline:** Week 2-3

2. **Console warnings in dev mode**
   - **Priority:** Low
   - **Impact:** Cosmetic only
   - **Mitigation:** Cleanup during Phase 2
   - **Timeline:** Week 3-4

3. **NLU requires Dialogflow CX setup**
   - **Priority:** Medium (documentation issue)
   - **Impact:** Optional feature, graceful fallback exists
   - **Mitigation:** Add comprehensive setup guide
   - **Timeline:** Week 4 (documentation phase)

### 4.2 Potential Risks

**Risk 1: Beta Tester Feedback Volume**
- **Impact:** High volume of feedback could delay stabilization
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prioritize critical/high bugs only for v3.0.0
  - Defer medium/low bugs to v3.0.1
  - Use triage labels (critical/high/medium/low)

**Risk 2: Performance Issues at Scale**
- **Impact:** Could require architectural changes
- **Probability:** Low (already tested with Zodiac App demo data)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run load tests with realistic data volumes
  - Identify bottlenecks early
  - Have scaling plan ready (caching, CDN, DB optimization)

**Risk 3: Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Impact:** Critical - could delay release
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run `npm audit` and fix all high/critical issues
  - Security code review (focus on file operations, terminal exec)
  - Dependency updates to latest secure versions
