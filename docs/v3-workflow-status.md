## Key Decisions

### ADR-004: Database Technology Choice (Pending)
- **Decision**: SQLite (dev) + PostgreSQL (production) with Prisma ORM
- **Rationale**: Proven stack, TypeScript native, migration support
- **Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase
- **Status**: To be formalized in ADR-004

### ADR-005: NLU Service Selection (Pending)
- **Decision**: Dialogflow CX (Google)
- **Rationale**: Enterprise-grade, good documentation, free tier
- **Alternatives Considered**: Rasa (open-source), Azure LUIS, Amazon Lex
- **Status**: To be formalized in ADR-005

### ADR-006: Real-time Collaboration Technology (Pending)
- **Decision**: Yjs (CRDT) + Socket.IO
- **Rationale**: Proven for collaborative editing, used by Notion/Figma
- **Alternatives Considered**: ShareDB, Automerge, custom OT
- **Status**: To be formalized in ADR-006

---

## Risks and Blockers

### Active Risks
1. **NLU Complexity**: Risk that Dialogflow integration takes longer than 4-6 weeks
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple intents, expand gradually

2. **Real-time Collaboration Complexity**: Risk that CRDT/OT implementation is too complex
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven library (Yjs), start with presence/chat only

3. **Timeline Optimism**: 16-20 weeks may be aggressive for 225 points
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental alpha releases, defer P2 features if needed

### Blockers
- None currently

## Notes

**MADACE Method Application**:
- This v3.0 project is being built using MADACE Method itself (meta-application)
- Level 3 (Comprehensive Planning) chosen due to complexity and multi-milestone structure
- PRD created by PM agent following MADACE workflow
- Next step: Architect agent will create technical specifications for Milestone 3.1

**Communication**:
- Weekly status updates in this file
- Milestone completion triggers alpha release to GitHub
- User feedback gathered after each milestone

---

**Next Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ PM creates PRD ‚Üê **DONE**
2. ‚úÖ Break down Milestone 3.1 into individual stories ‚Üê **DONE**
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Architect creates technical spec for database migration
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Set up v3.0 development branch
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Move [DB-001] to TODO and begin development
