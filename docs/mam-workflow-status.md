2. **Load SM Agent** - Begin story creation workflow
3. **Move [NEXT-001] to TODO** - First story: Initialize Next.js 14 project
4. **Implement Stories** - Follow MADACE workflow: TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE

**Velocity:**
- Week 1 completed: 24 points (planning phase)
- Target velocity: 15-20 points/week (implementation phase)
- Estimated completion: 3-4 weeks for Alpha MVP

## Notes

### Using MADACE to Build MADACE

This project is using the official MADACE-METHOD framework to plan and implement the experimental Next.js version. This meta-approach allows us to:
- Validate MADACE methodology in a real project
- Use proven workflow patterns
- Leverage AI agent guidance at each step
- Maintain proper story lifecycle management

### Architecture Status

**Current Architecture:** Next.js 14 Full-Stack TypeScript
- Single runtime: Node.js 20+
- Single language: TypeScript
- No FFI complexity
- Proven stack
- 4-week timeline (vs 12+ weeks with multi-tier)

See [ADR-003](../adrs/ADR-003-architecture-simplification.md) for full rationale.

### Agent Files Available

All MAM agents are available in `madace/mam/agents/`:
- **PM (Product Manager)** - Planning and scale assessment
- **Analyst** - Requirements and research
- **Architect** - Solution architecture and tech specs
- **SM (Scrum Master)** - Story lifecycle management
- **DEV (Developer)** - Implementation guidance

### Development Environment

Two deployment modes available:
1. **Development Container** (Recommended for coding)
   - VSCode Server at http://localhost:8080 (password: madace123)
   - Cursor IDE at http://localhost:8081
   - All tools pre-installed
   - Hot reload enabled
   - Start: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`

2. **Local Development**
   - Requires Node.js 20+, npm 9+
   - Manual dependency installation
   - Start: `npm run dev`

**Status:** ✅ Ready to begin implementation using MADACE workflow
**Next Action:** Load SM agent → Run `*create-story` → Move [NEXT-001] from BACKLOG to TODO
